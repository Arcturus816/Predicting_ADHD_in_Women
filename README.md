Attention Defecit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is a form of neurodiversity that can greatly impact a person's ability to engage with society in expected ways. Depending on the presentation of the disorder, a person with ADHD might find difficulty with anything from forming daily routines to managing and following though on important tasks to maintaining social connections and friendships. 

Having a formal diagnosis opens people up to resources and treatments that can help mitigate the challenges the disorder presents. Appropriate use of stimulants has been shown to improve the quality of life for both children and adults with ADHD. In many cases, recieving this diagnosis in elementry or middle school can help a child understand and address their differences and challenges early. This in turn lowers the risk that this child develops depression, anxiety, or other negative coping mechinisms. 

Historically, we associate the diagnosis of ADHD with the presentation seen most often in young boys. Hyperactivity and obvious impulsitivy have been key indicators that someone is struggling with ADHD. This characterization limits our understanding of the disorder and prevents timely diagnosis for people whose struggles present differently. 

I am interested in performing this analysis because this topics is important to me as an educator and friend.
